  This visualization shows food and agriculture statistics for the world's low-income countries for the period 2019-2021. The source datasets were provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, providing crop production totals and the resulting values. 
  The yearly output for all countries combined increased from 2019-2020 by 2.93%. From 2020 to 2021, the increase was .8%. This result stems, in part, from swarms of desert locusts ravaging countries across the Greater Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and Southwest Asia. Another factor was COVID-19 impacting production and farm families, along with the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season producing 30 storm systems, surpassing the usual 12-storm annual average. Effective Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) policies can influence agriculatural production systems but are at the mercy of drought, storms, pest, diseases and wildfires. 
  A map of each country and their resultant 2019-2021 crop totals is given, along with each named crop for a given year. All crops are given although some countries will not produce a given crop, while a country nearby will. For example, South Sudan does not produce sugar cane in measurable amounts, but South Sudan does. 
  This data and visualization is in the interest of assessment of the state of food security and progress towards achieving the hunger and food insecurity targets, progress towards the global nutrition targets defined by the World Health Assembly, and bringing the prevalence of undernourishment, and the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale into light.
